# Cipher Text

This was my final Python project for the 1st semester at Herald College Kathmandu.

## Overview
This project implements a basic cesar cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text. It showcases fundamental programming concepts learned during the course, such as string manipulation, functions, and user input handling.

## Features
- **Encryption**: Converts plain text into cipher text using Cesar Cipher.
- **Decryption**: Reverts the cipher text back to the original plain text.
- **Number**: Asks for a number to encrypt or decrypt the text.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rojin-0/Projects.git
